# Welcome

This is a Git repo for a project called 'Persons finder' to demo the use of REST API.

The idea is to create a set of API's that will feed a mobile application that has one purpose: find people around you.

Requirements:
- POST API to create a 'person'
- PUT API to update/create someone's location using latitude and longitude
- GET API to retrieve people around query location with a radius in KM, Use query param for radius. Extra challenge: Return list ordered by distance to each person.
- GET API to retrieve a person or persons name using their ids
- Responses must follow a JSON format

You'll also need to build the logic and services for saving/retrieving locations and persons.
